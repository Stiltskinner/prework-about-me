      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a former high school English teacher and current aspiring developer</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Austin, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video games, reading (mainly fantasy and sci-fi), board games, and political science. Yes, I am a huge nerd</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software developer or project manager</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Austin, Texas</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like solving problems and creating systems that are organized and efficient. If that sounds like generic corpo-speak, you should see my rimworld colony. I really mean it. Also, after being a teacher, I would find it refreshing to have the resources to do my best work and to be appreciated by society for the skilled work that I do.</p>
